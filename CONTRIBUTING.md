# Contributing to eBird Acornizer

Feel free to submit bug reports or suggestions/feature requests to the issue tracker, but please
first check existing issues and [TODO.txt](./TODO.txt).

Contributions via pull requests are welcome!

This is my first browser extension / userscript (originally, I wrote this as a Chrome extension).
I have very little experience with web development / JavaScript.
Clean up / refactoring contributions are therefore also quite welcome.
