Limitations:
* added filters are not respected (observe changes to filters and re-parse results)
 + ditto ebird sort
* prev/next nav does not respect custom ordering (need to apply same reordering to lightbox list)

Ideas:
* Favorite - filter and/or search option (Best Quality, Favorites first)
* Custom tags - config page to add custom tags that will appear in search filters and manage media pages
* Sort by number of ratings (then by quality)
* Sort by custom ranking
 + similar UI to: https://jsfiddle.net/dq8a0ttt/

Implementation
* Store mapping from asset id to:
 + species
 + author
 + aspect ratio
 + custom:
  - favorite
  - custom tags
  - custom ranking
* flex
