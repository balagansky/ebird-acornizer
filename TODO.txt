TODO:
* prev/next nav does not respect custom ordering (need to apply same reordering to lightbox list)
* display toggles on all media pages
 + media upload views
 + lightbox views
* Move/duplicate More Results button on top
 + Show number of results loaded so far
* Additional tags?
 + female/immature
 + injured (so users can hide these / show them last)
 + flock
* Custom tags
 + fade extension icon when not on qualifying pages
* improve styling
* keyboard shortcuts
* synthesize results from storage
 + filter for only favorites
  - best of species tag + filter
* tool to generate static html / integration with some simple/free static html hosting service

Ideas of unclear difficulty:
* Features related to species association
 + annotation of tagged photo counts on life list
 + show favorite photos in photo editing iteration views to aid in tagging
 + generate illustrated species gallery (from tagged favorites/add new species-best tag)

Known bugs:
* breaks if there is absolutely no filter set (not even mediaType=photos)
* sometimes updating filters doesn't add controls to results
